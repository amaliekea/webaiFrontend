            We are four Computer Science students — Luna, Amalie, Zuhur, and Anders — passionate about using technology to improve learning.
        </p>

        <p>
            StudyHelper was created as part of our semester project with the goal of making exam preparation more efficient, personalized, and interactive.
            As students ourselves, we know how overwhelming it can be to study for technical subjects like programming, databases, and system design.
        </p>

        <p>
            That’s why we built StudyHelper: a smart learning assistant powered by artificial intelligence that helps you:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Understand complex IT concepts through simplified explanations</li>
            <li>Generate study materials and summaries tailored to your level</li>
            <li>Practice with quizzes to reinforce what you've learned</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Our mission is to support fellow students in their learning journey and show how AI can be used not just for automation — but for education.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><em>We hope StudyHelper makes your studies a little easier — and maybe even a bit more fun!</em></p>
